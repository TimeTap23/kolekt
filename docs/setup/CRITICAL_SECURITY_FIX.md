# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIX REQUIRED

## **URGENT: RLS Security Vulnerabilities Detected**

Supabase has identified **critical security vulnerabilities** in your database. **9 public tables have Row Level Security (RLS) disabled**, which means your data is currently exposed to unauthorized access.

## **Affected Tables**
- `content_sources`
- `content_items`
- `content_embeddings`
- `post_schedules`
- `channel_posts`
- `review_queue`
- `channel_drafts`
- `engagement_metrics`
- `social_connections`

## **Immediate Action Required**

### **Step 1: Enable RLS on All Tables**
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Table Editor**
3. For each table listed above:
   - Click on the table name
   - Click **Settings** (gear icon)
   - Enable **Row Level Security (RLS)**

### **Step 2: Create Security Policies**
1. Go to **Authentication ‚Üí Policies**
2. For each table, create these policies:

#### **User Policies (for each table)**
```sql
-- Users can view their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own data" ON public.table_name
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can insert their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own data" ON public.table_name
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can update their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own data" ON public.table_name
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can delete their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own data" ON public.table_name
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### **Service Role Policy (for each table)**
```sql
-- Service role can access all data
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all data" ON public.table_name
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

### **Step 3: Test Your Application**
After enabling RLS and creating policies:
1. Test user registration and login
2. Test all CRUD operations
3. Verify admin dashboard functionality
4. Check that OAuth flows still work

## **Why This Is Critical**

Without RLS enabled:
- **Anyone can access your data** through the Supabase API
- **User data is exposed** to unauthorized users
- **Your application is vulnerable** to data breaches
- **This violates security best practices** and could lead to legal issues

## **After Fixing**

Once you've enabled RLS and created policies:
1. Run the security verification script again
2. Test all application functionality
3. Monitor for any broken features
4. Update this document with completion status
